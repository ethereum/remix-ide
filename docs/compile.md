Compiler (Solidity)
===================

Clicking the Solidity icon in the icon panel brings you to the Solidity Compiler.

Compiling is triggered when you click the compile button ( **D. in image below**). If you want the file to be compiled each time the file is saved or when another file is selected - check the auto compile checkbox ( **E. in image below**).

### Solidity versions & Remix functionality
Since the Solidity version `0.5.7`, it is possible to compile `Yul` files. Please read the ([solidity documentation about Yul](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/yul.html)) which contain some code examples.
You can use the language dropdown ( **B. in image below**) to switch the language. **This dropdown list is only available for versions greater than or equal to `0.5.7`.**

You can compile (and deploy) contracts with versions of Solidity **older than 0.4.12**.
However, the older compilers use a legacy AST â€” which we no longer support. Consequently, some plugins may not work and some functionality - like source highlighting in the Editor may only be partially working.

### Select an Ethereum fork
The "fork selection" dropdown list ( **C. in image below**) allows to compile code against a specific **ethereum hard fork**. 
The `compiler default` corresponds to the default hard fork used by a specific version. 

To see the name of the hard fork used in the current compilation, click the "Compilation Details" button( **G. in image below**) and in the `Metadata` section will be a sub-section called **settings**.  Open up the **settings** to see the hard fork's name.

### Auto Compile
If a contract has a lot of dependencies it can take a while to compile - so you use autocompilation at your discretion.

### Compilation Details and Publishing

Because a solidity file can include multiple contracts and because contracts can import other contracts,  **multiple contracts are often compiled**.  **However**, only 1 contract's compilation details can be retrieved at a time. 

To select the desired contract, use the **Contract select box** ( **F. in the image**).  

Using the publish button, you can upload your contract to Swarm (only non
abstract contracts can be published) & IPFS. 

When publishing contracts that import other contract,  the main contract and all of its imported contracts  will be published - each to their own address.

**Published data contains the `abi` and the solidity source code.**

After a contract is published, **a modal will pop up**.  This modal contains the contract's address as well as the addreses of the contracts that it imported and the address of the contract's **metadata**.

When the "Compilation Details" button is clicked ( **G. in image**), a modal opens displaying detailed information about the current selected contract.

### Compilation Errors and Warning
Compilation Errors and Warning are displayed below the contract section.
At each compilation, the static analysis tab builds a report. 

It is important to address reported issues even if the compiler doesn't complain. ([see more](static_analysis.html))

### Custom Solidity Compilers
For those writing your own custom solidity compiler, you can import that by clicking the **+** button (**X. in the image**) to open a modal where you can input the url of the compiler to be loaded.
