#: ../../static_analysis.md:4
msgid "Static code analysis is a process to debug the code by examining it and without actually executing the code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:6
msgid "Solidity Static Analysis plugin performs static analysis on Solidity smart contracts once they are compiled. It checks for security vulnerabilities and bad development practices, among other issues. It can be activated from Remix Plugin Manager."

msgid "How to use"
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:15
msgid "If you select this plugin, you will see a number of modules listed along with checkboxes, one Auto run checkbox and a Run button. Run button will be disabled as there is no compiled contract for now."
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:19
msgid "By default, all modules are selected for analysing a smart contract."
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:21
msgid "One can select/deselect the modules under which contract should be analyzed and can run the analysis for last compiled contract by clicking on Run."
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:23
msgid "If Auto run checkbox is checked, analysis will be performed each time a contract is compiled. Uncheck the checkbox if you want to stop this behaviour."
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:25
msgid "Run"
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:28
msgid "If Auto run checkbox is checked, analysis will be performed on compiling a contract and result will be shown as badge to the plugin icon. This number tells warnings count for the contract (e.g; 12 in attached image below) ."
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:30
msgid "By visiting the plugin UI, the details of the warning can be seen along with the category name for each warning."
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:32
msgid "Clicking on warning details will highlight the relevant code in the editor."

msgid "Analysis Modules"
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:40
msgid "Currently, with Remix IDE v0.10.1, there are 21 analysis modules listed under 4 categories. Categories are: Security, Gas & Economy, ERC & Miscellaneous."
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:42
msgid "Here is the list of modules under each category along with the example code which should be avoided or used very carefully while development:"
msgstr ""

msgid "Category: Security"
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:45
msgid "Transaction origin: 'tx.origin' is used"
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:47
msgid "tx.origin is useful only in very exceptional cases. If you use it for authentication, you usually want to replace it by \"msg.sender\", because otherwise any contract you call can act on your behalf."

msgid "Block timestamp: Semantics maybe unclear"
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:80
msgid "now does not mean current time. now is an alias for block.timestamp. block.timestamp can be influenced by miners to a certain degree, be careful."
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:91
msgid "Low level calls: Semantics maybe unclear"
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:93
msgid "Use of low level call, callcode or delegatecall should be avoided whenever possible. send does not throw an exception when not successful, make sure you deal with the failure case accordingly. Use transfer whenever failure of the ether transfer should rollback the whole transaction."

#: ../../static_analysis.md:100
msgid "Blockhash usage: Semantics maybe unclear"
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:102
msgid "blockhash is used to access the last 256 block hashes. A miner computes the block hash by \"summing up\" the information in the current block mined. By summing up the information in a clever way a miner can try to influence the outcome of a transaction in the current block."

msgid "Selfdestruct: Beware of caller contracts"
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:110
msgid "selfdestruct can block calling contracts unexpectedly. Be especially careful if this contract is planned to be used by other contracts (i.e. library contracts, interactions). Selfdestruction of the callee contract can leave callers in an inoperable state."

msgid "Gas costs: Too high gas requirement of functions"

#: ../../static_analysis.md:120
msgid "If the gas requirement of a function is higher than the block gas limit, it cannot be executed. Please avoid loops in your functions or actions that modify large areas of storage"

msgid "This on local calls: Invocation of local functions via 'this'"

#: ../../static_analysis.md:134
msgid "Never use this to call functions in the same contract, it only consumes more gas than normal local calls."
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:149
msgid "Delete on dynamic Array: Use require/assert appropriately"
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:151
msgid "The delete operation when applied to a dynamically sized array in Solidity generates code to delete each of the elements contained. If the array is large, this operation can surpass the block gas limit and raise an OOG exception. Also nested dynamically sized objects can produce the same results."
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:163
msgid "For loop over dynamic array: Iterations depend on dynamic array's size"
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:165
msgid "Loops that do not have a fixed number of iterations, for example, loops that depend on storage values, have to be used carefully: Due to the block gas limit, transactions can only consume a certain amount of gas. The number of iterations in a loop can grow beyond the block gas limit which can stall the complete contract at a certain point. Additionally, using unbounded loops can incur in a lot of avoidable gas costs. Carefully test how many items at maximum you can pass to such functions to make it successful."

The number of iterations in a loop can grow beyond the block gas limit which can cause the complete contract to be stalled at a certain point. If required, make sure that number of iterations are low and you trust each address involved."

msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:254
msgid "Use assert(x) if you never ever want x to be false, not in any circumstance (apart from a bug in your code). Use require(x) if x can be false, due to e.g. invalid input or a failing external component."

msgid "String Length: Bytes length != String length"
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:272
msgid "Bytes and string length are not the same since strings are assumed to be UTF-8 encoded (according to the ABI defintion) therefore one character is not nessesarily encoded in one byte of data."

msgid "Data Truncated: Division on int/uint values truncates the result"
msgstr ""

#: ../../static_analysis.md:299
msgid "Division of integer values yields an integer value again. That means e.g. 10 / 100 = 0 instead of 0.1 since the result is an integer again. This does not hold for division of (only) literal values since those yield rational constants."
