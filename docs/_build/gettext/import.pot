msgstr ""

#: ../../import.md:5
msgid "to import a library or dependency (for files you will NOT be editing)"

#: ../../import.md:10
msgid "When importing from NPM, or a URL (like github, a IPFS gateway, or a Swarm gateway) you do not need to do anything more than use the import statement in your contract. The dependencies do not need to be \"preloaded\" into the File Explorer's current Workspace before the contract is compiled."

#: ../../import.md:12
msgid "Files loaded from the import statement are placed in the Files Explorer's current Workspace's .deps folder."

#: ../../import.md:14
msgid "Under the hood, Remix checks to see if the files are already loaded in the .deps directory.  If not, it gets them via unpkg if it is an NPM lib."

msgid "Import from NPM"
msgstr ""

msgid "Note: In the example above, @openzeppelin is the name of the npm library.  In the following example the library's name does not begin with an @ - but Remix will go and check npm for a library of that name."

#: ../../import.md:37
msgid "You should specify the release tag (where available), otherwise you will get the latest code in the master branch.  For OpenZeppelin Contracts you should only use code published in an official release, the example above imports from OpenZeppelin Contracts v2.5.0."

#: ../../import.md:103
msgid "Notice that this import statement doesn't include the version information that was in the remix.load(url) command.  So it is recommended that you use the methods described at the top of this page for importing dependencies that you are not intending to edit."
