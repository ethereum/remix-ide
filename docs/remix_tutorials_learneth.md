Remix Tutorials with Learneth
=============================

**Learneth** is a tutorial platform integrated into Remix. 

Tutorials can contain quizzes for testing students' work.  These quizzes are run by Solidity Unit Tests.

We have a growing set of tutorials on our repo- but anyone can build tutorials on their own repos and have their students load them up!  

The tutorials contain .md files for instructions and can also contain example files, Solidity Unit Test files for quizzes, as well as answer files for a quizzes.
