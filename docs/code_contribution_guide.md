Code Contribution Guide
=======================

Remix is an open source tool and we encourage everyone to help us improve it.
Please open issues, give feedback or contribute by a pulling request
to our codebase.

The Remix application is built with JavaScript and it doesn't use any frameworks. We rely on a selected set of npm modules, like `yo-yo`, `csjs-inject` among others. Check out the `package.json` files in the Remix submodules to learn more about the stack.
