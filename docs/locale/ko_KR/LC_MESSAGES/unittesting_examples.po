#: ../../unittesting_examples.md:139
msgid "With Solidity, one can directly verify the changes made by a method in storage by retrieving those variables from a contract. But testing for a successful method execution takes some strategy. Well that is not entirely true, when a test is successful - it is usually obvious why it passed. However, when a test fails, it is essential to understand why it failed."
