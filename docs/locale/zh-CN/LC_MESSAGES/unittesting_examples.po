"In Solidity, msg.sender plays a great role in access management of a "

#: ../../unittesting_examples.md:139
msgid ""
"With Solidity, one can directly verify the changes made by a method in "
"storage by retrieving those variables from a contract. But testing for a "
"successful method execution takes some strategy. Well that is not "
"entirely true, when a test is successful - it is usually obvious why it "
"passed. However, when a test fails, it is essential to understand why it "
"failed."

"To help in such cases, Solidity introduced the try-catch statement in "
