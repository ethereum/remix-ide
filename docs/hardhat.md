Hardhat Integration
============

_(Supported since Remix IDE v0.12.0 and Remixd v0.3.6)_

Remixd and Hardhat
------------------

**Note:** If you have not used `remixd` before, read more about it [here](./remixd.html)

If `remixd` is running locally on your device and shared folder is a **Hardhat project**, an additional websocket plugin will be listening on port `65522`. According to its documentation,

> _Hardhat projects are npm projects with the hardhat package installed and a hardhat.config.js or hardhat.config.ts file._

Remixd looks for the `hardhat.config.js` or `hardhat.config.ts` file in shared folder, and if it finds the file, the Hardhat websocket listener will run.

The Hardhat websocket listener is a websocket plugin similar to `remixd` and is used to perform Hardhat specific actions with Remix IDE. 

It doesn't need any separate installation as it is shipped with [remixd NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@remix-project/remixd) module.

Enable Hardhat Compilation
------------------

### Prerequisites

To use Hardhat compilation with Remix IDE efficiently:

1. **Hardhat** should be installed locally on the system [https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#installation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#installation)
2. Shared folder should be a Hardhat project containing `hardhat.config.js` or `hardhat.config.ts`
3. `Remixd` Hardhat websocket listener should be running at `65522`

### How to use

If a hardhat project is shared through remixd and `localhost` workspace is loaded in Remix IDE, there will be an extra checkbox shown in `Solidity Compiler` plugin with the label `Enable Hardhat Compilation`.

There is an info icon along side the label which redirects to a specific section of Remix official documentation that explains how to use Hardhat compilation.

One can check the `Enable Hardhat Compilation` box to run the compilation for Hardhat along with the Remix using the compiler configuration in `Solidity Compiler` plugin.

On clicking `Compile` button, a file with `remix-compiler.config.js` will be created on the project root which will be storing compiler configuration set in Remix's `Solidity Compiler` plugin. It is passed to Hardhat for compilation.

The result of the compilation will be shown in the Remix IDE terminal

and also in the **remixd** terminal.

Hardhat Provider
------------------

_In Hardhat, contracts are deployed by starting a local node. Read more about it in [Hardhat documentation](https://hardhat.org/getting-started/#connecting-a-wallet-or-dapp-to-hardhat-network)_

**Hardhat Provider** is a plugin on Remix IDE which enables users to deploy the contract to the Hardhat 'localhost' network. This can be chosed from the `ENVIRONMENT` dropdown of `Deploy and Run Transactions` plugin.

As soon as you select `Hardhat Provider`, a modal is opened asking for the `Hardhat JSON-RPC Endpoint`.

If Hardhat node is running with default options, then the default endpoint value in modal will not need any change. In case, Hardhat node host and port are different, JSON-RPC endpoint should be updated in the modal text box.

Once the correct endpoint is filled in the modal, just click on `OK` and the accounts from the Hardhat node will be loaded in the `ACCOUNT` section. Network id will also be shown.

Now, one can start deploying the contract from Remix IDE to the Hardhat local node as usual.
