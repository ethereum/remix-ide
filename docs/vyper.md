# Vyper Compiler

Vyper contracts can be compiled in Remix with the **Vyper compiler**.

The plugin can be activated by going to:

1. the Plugin Manager and clicking on the Vyper compiler's activate button.
2. the File Explorer, then by right-clicking on a .vy file and selecting compile in the pop-up menu.
3. https://remix.ethereum.org/#activate=vyper

## Compiling a Vyper file

A Vyper file (with a .vy extension) needs to be the active file in the Editor. To get some example files, click on the **Clone Vyper examples repo** button. This will clone a repo and put it in a new Workspace. Go to the File Explorer to see the files.

## Specifying Vyper version, EVM versions, and optimize

To specify the Vyper version, the EVM version, and optimize setting, add a comment at the top of your .vy code as in the examples below:

### Specify Vyper version

As of 0.3.10, the recommended way to specify the version pragma is as follows:

```python
#pragma version ^0.3.10
```

### Old way to specify Vyper version

```python
# @version ^0.3.0
```

### EVM version

```python
# @pragma evm-version paris
```

### Optimize

```python
#pragma optimize codesize
```

For optimize, the choices options are `none`, `codesize`, or `optimize`.

For more info see the Vyperlang [docs](https://docs.vyperlang.org/en/stable/).

### Initiating compilation

There are 4 ways to compile:

1. Click the compile button in the plugin
2. Right-click on a .vy file in the File Explorer and select `Compile for Vyper`.
3. Click on the play button at the top left of the Main Panel when a .vy file is the active tab.
4. CTRL + s when a .vy file is in the active tab of the Main Panel.

## Remote vs Local compiler

The default is to use the remote compiler. To see the settings open up the Advanced Settings accordion box.

### Remote Compiler

The remote compilation is done using our remote containerized service that supports the official Vyper plugin for the Ape framework which ApeWorX maintains.

### Local Compiler

The local compilation can be done by connecting Remix Online IDE to your file system with {doc}`Remixd </remixd>` and then running a docker container that runs the Ape framework.

When the next version of Remix Desktop is ready, you’ll be able to run everything locally — both Remix, and the new Vyper compilers (still in Docker, of course).

## Compiler errors

When there are compiler errors in the Vyper plugin, a card will appear at the bottom of the compiler.

Errors appear one at a time. Fix one error, and the next one, if it exists, will appear.
