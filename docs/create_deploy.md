Creating and Deploying a Contract
================================

There are 3 type of environments Remix can be plugged to:
`Javascript VM`, `Injected provider`, or `Web3 provider`. (for details see [Running transactions](http://remix-ide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/run_tab.html))

Both `Web3 provider` and `Injected provider` require the use of an
external tool.

The external tool for `Web3 provider` is an Ethereum node and for
`Injected provider` Metamask.

The `JavaScript VM` mode is convenient because each execution runs in
your browser and you don't need any other software or Ethereum node to run it. 

So, it is the easiest test environment - **no setup required!**

But keep in mind that reloading the browser when you are in the Javascript VM will restart Remix in an empty state.

For performance purposes ( which is to say - for testing in an environment that is closest to the mainnet), it might also be better to use an external node.

Selecting the VM mode
---------------------

Make sure the VM mode is selected. All accounts displayed in `Accounts`
should have 100 ether.

Sample contract
---------------

``` 
{.sourceCode .none}
pragma solidity ^0.5.1;

contract testContract {

    uint value;

    constructor (uint _p) public {
        value = _p;
    }

    function setP(uint _n) payable public {
        value = _n;
    }

    function setNP(uint _n) public {
        value = _n;
    }

    function get () view public returns (uint) {
        return value;
    }
}

```

This contract is very basic. The goal is to quickly start to create and
to interact with a sample contract.

Deploying an instance
---------------------

The `Compile tab` displays information related to the current contract
(note that there can be more than one) (see ../compile\_tab).

Moving on, in the `Run tab` select, `JavaScript VM` to specify that you
are going to deploy an instance of the contract in the `JavaScript VM`
state.

The constructor of `Ballot.sol` needs a parameter (of type `uint8`).
Give any value and click on `Deploy`.

The transaction which deploys the instance of `Ballot` is created.

In a "normal" blockchain, it can take several seconds to execute. This
is the time for the transaction to be mined. However, because we are
using the `JavaScript VM`, our execution is immediate.

The terminal will inform you about the transaction. You can see details
there and start debugging.

The newly created instance is displayed in the `run tab`.

Interacting with an instance
----------------------------

This new instance contains 3 actions which corresponds to the 3
functions (`setP`, `setPN`, `get`). Clicking on `SetP` or `SetPN` will
create a new transaction.

Note that `SetP` is `payable` (red button) : it is possible to send
value (Ether) to the contract.

`SetPN` is not payable (orange button - depending on the theme) : it is not possible to send
value (Ether) to the contract.

Clicking on `get` will not execute a transaction (usually its a blue button - depending on the theme). It doesn't execute a transaction because a `get` does not modify the state (variable
`value`) of this instance.

As `get` is `view` you can see the return value just below the
action.
