Welcome to Remix documentation!
===============================

Remix is a powerful, open source tool that helps you write Solidity contracts straight from the browser.
Written in JavaScript, Remix supports both usage in the browser and locally.

Remix also supports testing, debugging and deploying of smart contracts and much more.

Our Remix project with all its features is available
at `remix.ethereum.org <http://remix.ethereum.org>`__ and more information can be found in these
docs.  Our IDE tool is available at `our GitHub repository
<https://github.com/ethereum/remix-ide>`__.

This set of documents covers instructions on how to use Remix and some tutorials to help you get started.
