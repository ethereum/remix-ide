Welcome to Remix's documentation!
=====================================

**Remix IDE** is used for the entire journey of smart contract development by users at every knowledge level. 
It requires no setup, fosters a fast development cycle, and has a rich set of plugins with intuitive GUIs.  
The IDE comes in two flavors (web app or desktop app) and as a VSCode extension.
