Welcome to Remix's documentation!
=====================================

Remix IDE is an open source web and desktop application. It fosters a fast development cycle and has a rich set of plugins with intuitive GUIs.  Remix is used for the entire journey of contract development as well as act as a playground for learning and teaching Ethereum.

Remix IDE is part of the Remix Project which is a platform for development tools that use a plugin architecture.  It encompasses sub-projects including Remix Plugin Engine, Remix Libs, and of course Remix-IDE.

Remix IDE is a powerful open source tool that helps you write Solidity contracts straight from the browser.

It is written in JavaScript and supports both usage in the browser, but run locally and in a desktop version.

Remix IDE has modules for testing, debugging and deploying of smart contracts and much more.

Remix-IDE is available
at `remix.ethereum.org <http://remix.ethereum.org>`__ and more information can be found in these
docs.  Our IDE tool is available at `our GitHub repository
<https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project>`__.

This set of documents covers instructions on how to use Remix.  Additional tutorials are found in our Medium blog and in our tutorial tool, `LearnEth <https://remix-alpha.ethereum.org/?#activate=solidity,solidityUnitTesting,LearnEth&call=LearnEth//startTutorial//ethereum/remix-workshops//master//solidityintroduction&deactivate=home&minimizeterminal=true->`__ located inside of Remix IDE.
